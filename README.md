# Neural Network Training with NumPy

This project implements the training of a neural network using basic matrix and vector operations in NumPy. The neural network consists of an input layer, hidden layers, and an output layer, trained using backpropagation.

## Features
- Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) with customizable architecture.
- Forward and backward passes (including backpropagation).
- Implemented using NumPy for matrix and vector operations.
- Error tracking and visualization with matplotlib.
